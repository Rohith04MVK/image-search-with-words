# Image Search with Words

<i>say goodbye to "i knew i had a pic of us at google"</i>

This is a **super basic** app I whipped up in a few hours to search your local image library with natural language.

**Keep in mind:**

- It's rough around the edges (like a first draft).
- It might not always understand your deepest artistic desires (the struggle is real).

**But hey,** it's a fun little experiment!

### What it does:

- Lets you search for images using plain English.
- Tries its best to understand what you're looking for based on your description.

### What it doesn't do

- Read minds (unfortunately, telepathy isn't included in this version).
- Guarantee picture-perfect results every time (sometimes the search just doesn't go our way).
- Make you breakfast

### See it in action
Check out this low-budget demo:

### How to use it (it's pretty straightforward)

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Rohith04MVK/image-search-with-words
```

2. Have [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) installed!

3. Install the dependencies

```sh
poetry install
poetry shell
```

4. Run the app!

```sh
streamlit run app.py
>>> Local URL: http://localhost:8501
```

5. Upload some images and hit search and see what appears!

**Bonus:**

- No internet connection required! Your images stay private on your device. (*inital run does require the internet :3)
